# Agri Connect 
## Introduction
This repository is the project of Team 119 (IIITDM) of DotSlash 5.0 hackathon. 
Our motivation is to ensure that farmers get a maximum profits for their crop and not middlemen. We have done this through giving royalty to farmer on each transaction of that crop. By following this famrer earns money and is not exploited. 
Also, we want to help the farmer to find transport to sell his crop in other place to earn more profit. We want made all the transactions transparent to every stakeholder.

## Problem Statement
To prevent farmers from being expoloited and give them a good profit for their crop through royalies.

## Functionalities
We have made an app called AgriConnect. The objective of this app is to connect farmers, traders and Consumers (end-user) in the agricultural industry. 
We have made a slab amount above which a fixed royalty percantage will be charged from traders and credited into famrer's wallet.
This app offers four login/ Sign up option  - 
1. Login as a farmer
2. Login as a trader
3. Login as a Consumer
4. Login as a transporter

All users can find their wallet balance on the home screen after logging in. They can also add money to their wallet.
This balance is updated in real-time and royalty amount is added directly to the farmer's wallet.

## Tech stack
We have used the following technologies:
1. Flutter
2. Firebase
3. Dart
4. Alan AI

## Alan AI integration
Alan AI voice assistant has been added to make all this process more convenient and easy. A user can give voice command to navigate between screens.
Farmer can easily interact with the AI assistant and complete the process.

## Future scope
This project has immense scope in the future and can be used by everyone for the benefit of farmers and customers. It will show the drastic difference between th price and which the farmers sell and at the cost at which we buy. Hopefully, it will bring a change in the society.
